# Forest_Cover_Type_Predictions
Predicting the cover types at Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado

# Requirements:
1. Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
2. Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
3. You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
4. You must use at least two of the following: 
Python Pandas
Python Matplotlib
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
JavaScript Plotly
JavaScript Leaflet
Tableau
SQL Database
MongoDB Database
Google Cloud SQL
Amazon AWS

# Data in SQL:
Put the name of the file or screen capture on the SQL table that holds the test and train dataset.

# Visualization 1:
Put here whatever visual agreed by the group.

# Visualization 2:
Put here whatever visual agreed by the group.

# Visualization n:
Put here whatever visual agreed by the group.

Joel Pangilinan
* Edited README file
* Studied the dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype
* Research on what machine learning framework I should use.  I settled with PyTorch
* Worked on cleaning the dataset for both test.csv and train.csv.  The clean datasets are in joel branch (clean_test.csv and clean_train.csv). 
* Worked on machine learning and saved the predicted cover types in joel branch - test_predictions.csv
* Worked on visualizations.  All png files are located in joel branch.
* Code for cleaning is joel_clean_dataset.ipynb at joel branch
* Code for machine learning is joel_machine_learning.ipynb at joel branch
* Code for visualizations is joel_visualize.ipynb at joel branch

Poonam Fandan
* Edited README file
* Studied the dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype
* Created two different Machine learning models using RandomForestClassifier and KNeighborsClassifier and compared the scores- Forest_cover_type_pred0.ipynb
* Created Postgresql database, created the SQL table “coverage_type”. Worked on loading the  covertypes data that was available in csv (covtype.csv) into “coverage_type”table.  The scripts to create the table and data load can be found in pfandan create_table_Cover_type.sql, Load_CSV_to_Cover_type.sql
